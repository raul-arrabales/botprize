1;Bot;ADANN;25;Male;FrequentGamer;10;Graduate;Sales Executive;Human;89;11;"My primary aspect was movement of the character, it wasn’t perfect and the player seemed not to know his way fully, kept guessing his way or where his enemies were at or where he could escape his way to; this is usually normal especially in a fast paced shooter game like this one. The body movement too wasn’t flawless, somewhat lagged as if someone was actually pressing a button over and over to change or head direction. If it were a robot, the movement and shooting could have been perfect."

1;Bot;ADANN;18;Male;Rookie;8;High School;None;Machine;25;75;i think it is a bot because the action it make is too sharp and rusty not smooth like how we human do it
1;Bot;ADANN;22;Male;FrequentGamer;15;Graduate;None;Human;100;0;It is a human player controlling the virtual character because the virtual character was shooting at walls, wasting ammo, missing a lot, and clearly shooting when no one is around. If this were AI controlling this virtual character, the AI would not have their character shoot at walls and shoot when no one is clearly around the character.

2;Bot;BotTracker;22;Male;FrequentGamer;15;Graduate;None;Human;100;0;The virtual character was controlled by a human player because there seemed to be a lot of uncertainty in the virtual character's movements. There were a lot of very subtle little movements the character would make, such as jumping a lot. At times you could tell that a controller key was gently being pressed to slightly nudge the character forward. An AI would be much more assertive or confident in it's movements.

2;Bot;BotTracker;18;Male;Gamer;12;High School;Student;Human;60;40;He dies by walking directly into enemy fire. If it were a bot(if coded weell) won't walk into that. However, at 1:03 he manages to run upto a player, expertly dodging fire even at close range. It could be that the player has great reflexes, but it does plant doubt in my mind.

2;Bot;BotTracker;18;Male;FrequentGamer;11;High School;Cashier;Human;70;30;The AI in unreal are pretty good at following their path, in the video it looks like someone pretending to be a bot but has no idea what a bot would act like, and also the bots don't shot at walls randomly when a player gets in their trigger zone they will be firing towards the player.

2;Bot;BotTracker;20;Male;Rookie;10;Undergraduate;Student;Machine;0;100;The game screen angle or the camera angle was such that it is very difficult for a human to interpret from where his enemies are coming, adjusting the shooting target to enemies location.

3;Bot;MirrorBot;22;Male;FrequentGamer;15;Graduate;None;Machine;0;100;The virtual character is being controlled by AI because the virtual character seems to react more than anything. When there are no other characters around, the virtual character being controlled doesn't seem to do much. Also, there were times when the character was shooting at another and would stop shooting when the other character would reload. Any human player would have kept shooting. There were moments when the character seemed confused.

3;Bot;MirrorBot;25;Male;FrequentGamer;10;Graduate;Sales Executive;Human;100;0;The player doesn’t make a move unless he is sure of. The fireballs or bullets could be seen, and the player was able to escape or dodge most, but he could still get hit-which even further defines human perfection, we are not perfect like some machine given some code, we act on instinct which the player is very much doing. The player also realizes the bullets don’t give fatal hits so he doesn’t care much when he tries to perfect his shot. Such awareness is pretty much human.

5;Human;tmchojo;19;Male;Gamer;2;Graduate;Student;Human;90;10;its slow movement in the game is the primary aspect to make the decision
5;Human;tmchojo;25;Male;FrequentGamer;10;Graduate;Sales Executive;Human;100;0;In around 40 seconds of the clip, the player uses a gun with rapid bullets, this enable to shoot from a distance but at a cost of accuracy. He has to shoot many times to kill them, and it just doesn’t work for him. So what he does is to close range mode, takes his time and carefully gets closer to the enemy, when close enough, he kicks the enemy or launch a missile which flies them over. Such calculated judgments can only be done by a human. 
5;Human;tmchojo;22;Male;FrequentGamer;15;Graduate;None;Machine;0;100;This was an AI player because there were a few moments that the virtual player had a shot lined up at another player but waited about a second or two before taking the shot. It seemed almost as if the player were processing or deciding what to do. The player remained still before taking action. If this were a human player, there would have been no hesitation in what to do.

6;Human;Xenjia;18;Male;FrequentGamer;12;Graduate;Production Worker;Human;100;0;The virtual character maneuvered well and did not seem stiff as if programmed or in other words controlled by a machine.
6;Human;Xenjia;22;Male;FrequentGamer;15;Graduate;None;Human;100;0;The virtual player was being controlled by a human because the player seemed to be actively exploring the map searching out other opponent players. An AI player seems to react more than anything. Also, there were times when this player changed their weapon. It seemed as if the player was changing the weapon to best suit the situation. This player actively changed the weapon a few times making me think an AI wouldn't do something like this
6;Human;Xenjia;25;Male;FrequentGamer;10;Graduate;Sales Executive;Human;98;2;Realistic shooting behavior my primary aspect. Movements were normal, run from your spot if you can’t shoot right. The player actually used the yellow character between 30-32 seconds as a shield, which is a typical of a smart human. Was busy with front enemy since he had to use the yellow guy as shield before he dies, he kept on even when there was an enemy behind who wasn’t even shooting. After the front enemy was down, went back for the bad guy behind. Pretty much human with a very good eye though. A machine can’t make such clever judgments

6;Human;Xenjia;25;Male;Rookie;1;Graduate;Store Manager;Machine;40;60;wasnt very sure which one it could have been. however i ended up decided machine because they were very good at following the individuals and it just seemed like that kind of accuracy would be a machine.

7;Bot;CCBot2;31;Female;Gamer;15;High School;Administrative Asssistant;Human;85;15;Jaunty and erratic movement. It seemed to indicate the sort of frantic fumbling a player can make when deep in gameplay mode.
7;Bot;CCBot2;22;Male;FrequentGamer;15;Graduate;None;Human;100;0;This character is controlled by a human because there is a moment when the player is being shot at and all the player is doing is jumping around in circles trying to evade the shots. I don't think any AI would jump around trying to evade being shot at. An AI would shoot back. But this player clearly did not shoot back at one point when being shot at. All they did was jump in circles and try to run away.
7;Bot;CCBot2;30;Male;Gamer;15;Graduate;Web Designer;Human;100;0;I guess the virtual character moves, it surely played by good human player.
7;Bot;CCBot2;30;Female;Rookie;10;Graduate;Biologist;Human;100;0;I'm not quite sure, maybe some of the movements and tries to move one way or another.
7;Bot;CCBot2;25;Male;FrequentGamer;10;Graduate;Sales Executive;Machine;10;90;Ignorance is my primary aspect in defining behavior. The character has no idea of what to do in the game. Keeps jumping on the same place and making random shootings even when the enemy wasn’t even there. If it was human playing, then he had no idea and the computer or machine was telling him “you could jump or shoot like this….try it.” This was machine except for the last seconds maybe.

8;Human;JuanCVC;24;Male;Gamer;11;Postgraduate;Researcher;Human;100;0;The character was not acting too fast. And, the character was randomly moving here and there to reach the targets with hesitation.
8;Human;JuanCVC;22;Male;FrequentGamer;15;Graduate;None;Machine;0;100;This player was controlled by an AI because there was one moment when the player was shooting at another player moving side to side. And the player was hitting the moving target with great precision. A human could do this, but I think it's unlikely. Also, there was anther moment when the area seemed to be momentarily clear of other players and the player being focused on was moving back forth, back forth not stopping as if it was waiting to react to the next player to come near it.

8;Human;JuanCVC;25;Male;FrequentGamer;10;Graduate;Sales Executive;Human;90;10;"Amateur gameplay is my primary aspect. The shootings in the first 10 seconds and around 29 seconds worry me a lot if this. The player didn’t just care if shot at, the bullets came at him on and on, and had no fear of enemy zones. The character behaved as if he was wearing some body armor or some shield to protect him yet I could still see blood gushing out on every bullet taken. The player just had no fear for enemy territory zone, and with almost zero strategy on entry; almost zero cautious; no wonder he kept dying. But again the shooting accuracy was not perfect for a machine unless the game was designed to make random shots to get an enemy down. And was hardly successful which defines those above errors. So this was definitely human but an amateur with this game."

9;Bot;NizorBot;22;Male;FrequentGamer;15;Graduate;None;Human;100;0;This player was controlled by a human because in the beginning the player was jumping around and shooting at the walls when clearly no enemy was around. It almost seemed as if the person controlling this character was trying to figure out how the controls worked. An AI player would not waste shots shooting at walls, they would react and only shoot when an enemy is around.
9;Bot;NizorBot;24;Male;Gamer;11;Postgraduate;Researcher;Human;100;0;The virtual character was not that much fast and seem to be moving here and there without determining the actual destination. There was also a delay in the beginning for the character to start moving.
9;Bot;NizorBot;25;Male;FrequentGamer;10;Graduate;Sales Executive;Human;95;5;Patience is my primary aspect in defining behavior. The player had to wait for almost a minute for the enemy to come in the first minute. The player realizes how tense the game could get, just as it got after 1 minute. The patience is actually fear of dying. The player is not good at the game, he keeps running away from the enemies, makes a move when they are not there or there are few of them. This is pretty human behaviour.

9;Bot;NizorBot;20;Male;Rookie;10;Undergraduate;Student;Machine;0;100;I think that in the vedio a person is just watching how advanced human bot are playing the game as the location of the screen or camera angle was such that it was impossible for a human to analyze his enemy location and to shoot them on the target while preventing himself getting hurt.
9;Bot;NizorBot;39;Male;FrequentGamer;35;High School;Bartender;Machine;0;100;. At the beginning the bot was just standing there and then started spinning around shooting at nothing. Also the bot ran half the map backwards making every turn.

10;Bot;OvGUBot;25;Male;Rookie;1;Postgraduate;Store Manager;Human;90;10;i think a human because they were running around a lot. they also were killed quite a bit which suggests human.
10;Bot;OvGUBot;25;Male;FrequentGamer;10;Graduate;Sales Executive;Human;100;0;Quite impressed with Character 10. My primary aspect of perception of behavior is based on the judgment of the player. In the first 19 seconds, the player wanted to collect an orb or something shining. He didn’t just go for it, like some robot making calculations within milliseconds and still making a perfect short. The player made a perfect human behavior of making a judgment on the enemy, how quick they short back at unknown entry, and the direction of the shooting and then made the run. The same thing happened on the 90th second. Such judgments were made by a human player who knew was playing with a computer and just couldn’t think like him. Only a human can think like that in gaming.
10;Bot;OvGUBot;24;Male;Gamer;10;Graduate;Selfemployed;Human;100;0;.player moving very slowly,low accuracy,computer does not do that
10;Bot;OvGUBot;22;Male;FrequentGamer;15;Graduate;None;Human;100;0;This virtual player was controlled by a human because there were a few moments when this player would shoot at the walls. I can see how even an AI player can shoot and hit the wall by missing a player but when you have aimed at the wall and fire, that seems more like a human thing to do. Also, there was a moment when the player would jump on the moving platform then jump off, jump on and then jump off again. With whatever is controlling this character there seems to be some thought going behind this and some form of strategy which is another reason why I think it's a human.
10;Bot;OvGUBot;24;Male;Gamer;6;Graduate;Student;Machine;30;70;week response to attack
10;Bot;OvGUBot;20;Male;Rookie;10;Undergraduate;Student;Human;100;0;It is definetely an human bot as it made certain mistakes while playing such as misinterpreting enemy's location and shooting on the wall and getting shot by the enemy at the same instant. 
10;Bot;OvGUBot;34;Male;FrequentGamer;7;Graduate;Executive;Machine;10;90;because of the fast moments my decision is Machine
10;Bot;OvGUBot;18;Male;FrequentGamer;10;High School;None;Human;95;5;. The wy the character moves, and the reflexes seems that cames from Human
10;Bot;OvGUBot;19;Male;Gamer;10;High School;Student;Machine;20;80;Movement seemed fluid like controlled by machine and some movement seemed unnecessary.
10;Bot;OvGUBot;21;Female;HardcoreGamer;11;High School;Student;Machine;0;100;Random and unnecessary shooting/jumping/movement. Character seems not to interact with other players unless they shoot him first.

11;Human;Joan1;47;Female;Gamer;3;High School;Homemaker;Human;100;0;When I observed the character backing up. In my opinion, an AI would not back up to play a game
11;Human;Joan1;25;Male;FrequentGamer;10;Graduate;Sales Executive;Human;82;18;"Mostly my primary aspect is the shooting accuracy. The only thing I saw; like in the first 12 seconds, that actually got an enemy down was the missile or grenade launcher….and it was not even direct hit at the enemy but just nearby which is typical of humans, they are not always accurate. Accuracy you talking of the timeframe for holding the button to define distance, and direction too, this is rarely perfect unless the computer finishes the job for you. On the other shootings, this was some scared player; I imagine, who could make some random shootings just in case the enemy pops up or jumps to that direction, which is very much normal for fast paced games. And the shooting wasn’t perfect, could miss which is normal for a human. And actually the enemy had to be short at 2-3 times to go down which may mean the player could not accurately hit the most venerable parts of the enemy."
